## 10.1.3 L4 Interconnect

The L4 interconnect is a non-blocking peripheral interconnect that provides low latency access to a large number of low bandwidth, physically dispersed target cores. The L4 can handle incoming traffic from up to four initiators and can distribute those communication requests to and collect related responses from up to 63 targets.

This device provides three interfaces with L3 interconnect for High Speed Peripheral, Standard Peripheral, and Wakeup Peripherals. . Figure 10-2 shows the L4 bus architecture and memory-mapped peripherals.
