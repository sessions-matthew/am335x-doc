## 5.0.12 Universal Scalable Shader Engine (USSE) - Key Features

The USSE is the engine core of the POWERVR SGX architecture and supports a broad range of instructions.

- Single programming model:
- -Multithreaded with 16 simultaneous execution threads and up to 64 simultaneous data instances
- -Zero-cost swapping in, and out, of threads
- -Cached program execution model
- -Dedicated pixel processing instructions
- -Dedicated video encode/decode instructions
- SIMD execution unit supporting operations in:
- -32-bit IEEE float
- -2-way 16-bit fixed point
- -4-way 8-bit integer
- -32-bit bit-wise (logical only)
- Static and dynamic flow control:
- -Subroutine calls
- -Loops
- -Conditional branches
- -Zero-cost instruction predication
- Procedural geometry:
- -Allows generation of primitives
- -Effective geometry compression
- -High-order surface support
- External data access:
- -Permits reads from main memory using cache
- -Permits writes to main memory
- -Data fence facility
- -Dependent texture reads
