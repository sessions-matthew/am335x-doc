## 7.4.4.2 Use Case: ELM Used in Continuous Mode

In this example, the ELM module is programmed for an 8-bit error-correction capability in continuous mode. After reading a 528-byte NAND flash sector (512B data plus 16B spare area) with a 16-bit interface, a non-zero polynomial syndrome is reported from the GPMC (Polynomial syndrome 0 is used in the ELM):

The NAND flash data in the sector are seen as a polynomial of degree 4223 (number of bits in a 528 byte buffer minus 1), with each data bit being a coefficient in the polynomial. When reading from a NAND flash using the GPMC module, computation of the polynomial syndrome assumes that the first NAND word read at address 0x0 contains the highest-order coefficient in the message. Furthermore, in the 16-bit NAND word, bits are ordered from bit 7 to bit 0, then from bit 15 to bit 8. Based on this convention, an address table of the data buffer can be built. NAND memory addresses in Table 7-285 are given in decimal format.

The table can now be used to determine which bits in the buffer were incorrect and must be flipped. In this example, the first bit to be flipped is bit 4 from the 49th byte read from memory. It is up to the processor to correctly map this word to the copied buffer and to flip this bit. The same process must be repeated for all detected errors.

## 7.4.4.3 Use Case: ELM Used in Page Mode

In this example, the ELM module is programmed for an 16-bit error-correction capability in page mode. After reading a 528-byte NAND flash sector (512B data plus 16B spare area) with a 16-bit interface, four non-zero polynomial syndromes are reported from the GPMC (Polynomial syndrome 0, 1, 2, and 3 are used in the ELM):

- P0 = 0xE8B0 12ADDB5A318E05BE B0693DB28330B5CC A329AA05E0B718EF
- P1 = 0xBAD0 49A0D932C22E6669 0948DF08BE093336 79C6BA10E5F935EB
- P2 = 0x69D9 B86ABCD5EC3697FA A6498FEE54556EA0 1579EF7D60BA3189
- P3 = 0x0
