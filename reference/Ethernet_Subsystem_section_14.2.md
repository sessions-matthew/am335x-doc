## 14.2 Integration

This device includes a single instantiation of the three-port Gigabit Ethernet Switch Subsystem (CPSW\_3GSS\_RG). The switch provides 2 external ethernet ports (ports 1 and 2) and an internal CPPI interface port (port 0) with IEEE 1588v2 and 802.1ae support. The subsystem consists of:

- One instance of the 3-port Gigabit switch CPSW-3G, which contains:
- -2 CPGMAC\_SL 10/100/1000 ethernet port modules with GMII interface
- Two RGMII interface modules
- Two RMII interface modules
- One MDIO interface module
- One Interrupt Controller module
- Local CPPI memory of size 8K Bytes

The integration of the Ethernet Switch is shown in Figure 14-1
