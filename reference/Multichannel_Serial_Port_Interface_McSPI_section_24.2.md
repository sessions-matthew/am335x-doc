## 24.2 Integration

This device includes two instantiations of McSPI: SPI0 and SPI1. The McSPI module is a general-purpose receive/transmit master/slave controller that can interface with either up to four slave external devices or one single external master. Figure 24-1 shows the example of a system with multiple external slave SPI compatible devices and Figure 24-2 shows the example of a system with an external master.
