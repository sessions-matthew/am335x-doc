| GMII_TXD[3:0] | O      | The transmit data pins are a collection of 4 data signals GMII_TXD[3:0] comprising 4 bits of data. GMII_TXD[0] is the least-significant bit (LSB). The signals are synchronized by GMII_TXCLK and valid only when GMII_TXEN is asserted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| GMII_TXEN     | O      | The transmit enable signal indicates that the GMII_TXD[3:0] pins are generating 4-bit data for use by the PHY. It is driven synchronously by GMII_TXCLK                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| GMII_COL      | I      | In half-duplex operation, the GMII_COL pin is asserted by the PHY when it detects a collision on the network. It remains asserted while the collision condition persists. This signal is not necessarily synchronous to GMII_TXCLK nor GMII_RXCLK In full-duplex operation, the GMII_COL pin is used for hardware transmit flow control. Asserting the GMII_COL pin stops packet transmissions; packets transmitting when MCOL is asserted will complete transmission. The GMII_COL pin should be held low if hardware transmit flow control is not used |
| GMII_CRS      | I      | In half-duplex operation, the GMII_CRS pin is asserted by the PHY when the network is not idle in either transmit or receive. The pin is deasserted when both transmit and receive are idle. This signal is not necessarily synchronous to GMII_TXCLK nor GMII_RXCLK. In full-duplex operation, the GMII_CRS pin should be held low.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| GMII_RXCLK    | I      | The receive clock is a continuous clock that provides the timing reference for receive operations. The GMII_RXD, GMII_RXDV, and MRXER signals are tied to this clock.

| MDIO_DATA     | I/O    | The MDIO_DATA pin drives PHY management data into and out of the PHY by way of an access frame consisting of start of frame, read/write indication, PHY address, register address, and data bit cycles. The MDIO_DATA pin acts as an output for all but the data bit cycles at which time it is an input for read operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
