| Signal        | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RGMII_TD[3-0] | O      | The transmit data pins are a collection of 4 bits of data. RGMII_RD0 is the least- significant bit (LSB). The signals are valid only when RGMII_TCTL is asserted. |
| RGMII_TCTL    | O      | Transmit Control/enable .The transmit enable signal indicates that the RGMII_TD pins are generating data for use by the PHY.                                      |
| RGMII_TCLK    | O      | The transmit reference clock will be 125Mhz, 25Mhz, or 2.5Mhz depending on speed of operation.                                                                    |
| RGMII_RD[3-0] | I      | The receive data pins are a collection of 4 bits of data. RGMII_RD is the least- significant bit (LSB). The signals are valid only when RGMII_RCTL is asserted.   |

| Signal     | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RGMII_RCTL | I      | The receive data valid/control signal indicates that the RGMII_RD pins are nibble data for use by the 3PSW.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| RGMII_RCLK | I      | The receive clock is a continuous clock that provides the timing reference for receive operations.The clock is generated by the PHY and is 2.5 MHz at 10 Mbps operation and 25 MHz at 100 Mbps operation,125 MHz at 1000Mbps of operation.                                                                                          |
| MDIO_CLK   | O      | Management data clock. The MDIO data clock is sourced by the MDIO module on the system. It is used to synchronize MDIO data access operations done on the MDIO pin.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| MDIO_DATA  | I/O    | MDIO DATA. MDIO data pin drives PHY management data into and out of the PHY by way of an access frame consisting of start of frame, read/write indication,PHY address, register address, and data bit cycles. The MDIO_DATA pin acts as an output for all but the data bit cycles at which time it is an input for read operations. |
