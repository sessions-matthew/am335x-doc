The contains the subsystems shown in the Functional Block Diagram and a brief description of each follows:

The microprocessor unit (MPU) subsystem is based on the ARM Cortex-A8 processor and the PowerVR SGX™ Graphics Accelerator subsystem provides 3D graphics acceleration to support display and gaming effects.

The PRU-ICSS is separate from the ARM core, allowing independent operation and clocking for greater efficiency and flexibility. The PRU-ICSS enables additional peripheral interfaces and real-time protocols such as EtherCAT, PROFINET, EtherNet/IP, PROFIBUS, Ethernet Powerlink, Sercos, and others. Additionally, the programmable nature of the PRU-ICSS, along with its access to pins, events and all system-on-chip (SoC) resources, provides flexibility in implementing fast, real-time responses, specialized data handling operations, custom peripheral interfaces, and in offloading tasks from the other processor cores of SoC.

## 4.2 Pin Attributes

The AM335x and AMIC110 Sitara Processors Technical Reference Manual and this document may reference internal signal names when discussing peripheral input and output signals because many of the AM335x package terminals can be multiplexed to one of several peripheral signals. The following table has a Pin Name column that lists all device terminal names and a Signal Name column that lists all internal signal names multiplexed to each terminal which provides a cross reference of internal signal names to terminal names. This table also identifies other important terminal characteristics.

- (1) BALL NUMBER: Package ball numbers associated with each signals.
- (2) PIN NAME:
3. The name of the package pin or terminal. Note : The table does not take into account subsystem terminal multiplexing options.
- (3) SIGNAL NAME : The signal name for that pin in the mode being used.
- (4) MODE: Multiplexing mode number.
- a. Mode 0 is the primary mode; this means that when mode 0 is set, the function mapped on the terminal corresponds to the name of the terminal. There is always a function mapped on the primary mode. Notice that primary mode is not necessarily the default mode.

Note: The default mode is the mode at the release of the reset; also see the RESET REL. MODE column.

- b. Modes 1 to 7 are possible modes for alternate functions. On each terminal, some modes are effectively used for alternate functions, while some modes are not used and do not correspond to a functional configuration.
- (5) TYPE: Signal direction
3. -I = Input
4. -O = Output
5. -I/O = Input and Output
6. -D = Open drain
7. -DS = Differential
8. -A = Analog
9. -PWR = Power
10. -GND = Ground

Note : In the safe\_mode, the buffer is configured in high-impedance.

- (6) BALL RESET STATE: State of the terminal while the active low PWRONRSTn terminal is low.
2. -0: The buffer drives V OL (pulldown or pullup resistor not activated)
3. 0(PD): The buffer drives VOL with an active pulldown resistor
4. -1: The buffer drives V OH (pulldown or pullup resistor not activated)
5. 1(PU): The buffer drives VOH with an active pullup resistor
6. -Z: High-impedance
7. -L: High-impedance with an active pulldown resistor
8. -H : High-impedance with an active pullup resistor
- (7) BALL RESET REL. STATE: State of the terminal after the active low PWRONRSTn terminal transitions from low to high.
10. -0: The buffer drives V OL (pulldown or pullup resistor not activated)
11. 0(PD): The buffer drives VOL with an active pulldown resistor
12. -1: The buffer drives V OH (pulldown or pullup resistor not activated)
13. 1(PU): The buffer drives VOH with an active pullup resistor
14. -Z: High-impedance.
15. -L: High-impedance with an active pulldown resistor
16. -H : High-impedance with an active pullup resistor
- (8) RESET REL. MODE: The mode is automatically configured after the active low PWRONRSTn terminal transitions from low to high.
- (9) POWER: The voltage supply that powers the I/O buffers of the terminal.
- (10) HYS: Indicates if the input buffer is with hysteresis.
- (11) BUFFER STRENGTH: Drive strength of the associated output buffer.
- (12) PULLUP OR PULLDOWN TYPE: Denotes the presence of an internal pullup or pulldown resistor. Pullup and pulldown resistors can be enabled or disabled via software.
- (13) I/O CELL: I/O cell information.

Note : Configuring two terminals to the same input signal is not supported as it can yield unexpected results. This can be easily prevented with the proper software configuration.

## 4.3 Signal Descriptions

The AM335x device contains many peripheral interfaces. In order to reduce package size and lower overall system cost while maintaining maximum functionality, many of the AM335x terminals can multiplex up to eight signal functions. Although there are many combinations of pin multiplexing that are possible, only a certain number of sets, called I/O Sets, are valid due to timing limitations. These valid I/O Sets were carefully chosen to provide many possible application scenarios for the user.

Texas Instruments has developed a Windows-based application called Pin Mux Utility that helps a system designer select the appropriate pin-multiplexing configuration for their AM335x-based product design. The Pin Mux Utility provides a way to select valid I/O Sets of specific peripheral interfaces to ensure the pinmultiplexing configuration selected for a design only uses valid I/O Sets supported by the AM335x device.

(1) Stresses beyond those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated under Recommended Operating Conditions is not implied. Exposure to absolute-maximum-rated conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

(2) All voltage values are with respect to their associated VSS or VSSA\_x.

(3) Not available on the ZCE package. VDD\_MPU is merged with VDD\_CORE on the ZCE package.

(4) This supply is sourced from an internal LDO when RTC\_KALDO\_ENn is low. If RTC\_KALDO\_ENn is high, this supply must be sourced from an external power supply.

## Absolute Maximum Ratings (continued)

over junction temperature range (unless otherwise noted)(1)(2)

- (5) During functional operation, this pin is a no connect.
- (6) Not available on the ZCE package.
- (7) This terminal is connected to a fail-safe I/O and does not have a dependence on any I/O supply voltage.
- (8) This parameter applies to all I/O terminals which are not fail-safe and the requirement applies to all values of I/O supply voltage. For example, if the voltage applied to a specific I/O supply is 0 volts the valid input voltage range for any I/O powered by that supply will be -0.5 to +0.3 V. Apply special attention anytime peripheral devices are not powered from the same power sources used to power the respective I/O supply. It is important the attached peripheral never sources a voltage outside the valid input voltage range, including power supply ramp-up and ramp-down sequences.
- (9) This terminal is connected to analog circuits in the respective USB PHY. The circuit sources a known current while measuring the voltage to determine if the terminal is connected to VSSA\_USB with a resistance less than 10 Ω or greater than 100 k Ω . The terminal should be connected to ground for USB host operation or open-circuit for USB peripheral operation, and should never be connected to any external voltage source.
- (10) Based on JEDEC JESD78D [ IC Latch-Up Test ].
- (11) For tape and reel the storage temperature range is [-10°C; +50°C] with a maximum relative humidity of 70%. TI recommends returning to ambient room temperature before usage.

- (13) Latch-up pin group B: R1, R2, R3, R4, T1, T2, T3, V2, V3
- (14) Latch-up pin group C: T4, U1, U2, U3, U4, V5, F17, F18, G15, G16, G17, G18, H16, H17, J15, J16, J17, J18, K15, K16, K17, K18, L18, L17, L16, L15, M16, H18, M17, M18

Fail-safe I/O terminals are designed such they do not have dependencies on the respective I/O power supply voltage. This allows external voltage sources to be connected to these I/O terminals when the respective I/O power supplies are turned off. The USB0\_VBUS and USB1\_VBUS are the only fail-safe I/O terminals. All other I/O terminals are not fail-safe and the voltage applied to them should be limited to the value defined by the steady state max. Voltage at all I/O pins parameter in Section 5.1.

## 5.8 Thermal Resistance Characteristics for ZCE and ZCZ Packages

Failure to maintain a junction temperature within the range specified in Section 5.5 reduces operating lifetime, reliability, and performance-and may cause irreversible damage to the system. Therefore, the product design cycle should include thermal analysis to verify the maximum operating junction temperature of the device. It is important this thermal analysis is performed using specific system use cases and conditions. TI provides an application report to aid users in overcoming some of the existing challenges of producing a good thermal design. For more information, see AM335x Thermal Considerations .

Table 5-12 provides thermal characteristics for the packages used on this device.

(1) VREFP and VREFN must be tied to ground if the internal voltage reference is used.

(2) This parameter is valid when the respective AIN terminal is configured to operate as a general-purpose ADC input.

## 6 Power and Clocking

## 6.1 Power Supplies

## 6.1.1 Power Supply Slew Rate Requirement

To maintain the safe operating range of the internal ESD protection devices, TI recommends limiting the maximum slew rate for powering on the supplies to be less than 1.0E +5 V/s. For instance, as shown in Figure 6-1, TI recommends a value greater than 18 µs for the supply ramp slew for a 1.8-V supply.

- A. RTC\_PWRONRSTn should be asserted for at least 1 ms to provide enough time for the internal RTC LDO output to reach a valid level before RTC reset is released.
- B. When using the ZCZ package option, VDD\_MPU and VDD\_CORE power inputs may be powered from the same source if the application only uses operating performance points (OPPs) that define a common power supply voltage for VDD\_MPU and VDD\_CORE. The ZCE package option has the VDD\_MPU domain merged with the VDD\_CORE domain.
- C. If a USB port is not used, the respective VDDA1P8V\_USB terminal may be connected to any 1.8-V power supply and the respective VDDA3P3V\_USB terminal may be connected to any 3.3-V power supply. If the system does not have a 3.3-V power supply, the VDDA3P3V\_USB terminal may be connected to ground.
- D. If the system uses mDDR or DDR2 memory devices, VDDS\_DDR can be ramped simultaneously with the other 1.8-V I/O power supplies.
- E. VDDS\_RTC can be ramped independent of other power supplies if PMIC\_POWER\_EN functionality is not required. If VDDS\_RTC is ramped after VDD\_CORE, there might be a small amount of additional leakage current on VDD\_CORE. The power sequence shown provides the lowest leakage option.
- F. To configure VDDSHVx [1-6] as 1.8 V, power up the respective VDDSHVx [1-6] to 1.8 V following the recommended sequence. To configure VDDSHVx [1-6] as 3.3 V, power up the respective VDDSHVx [1-6] to 3.3 V following the recommended sequence.
- G. If all the 1.8-V supplies are not sourced from the same power supply, it is required to power up VDDS before other 1.8-V supplies. Further, it is also recommended to source VDDS and VDDSHvx [x = 1-6] when configured as 1.8V from the same power supply.

- A. RTC\_PWRONRSTn should be asserted for at least 1 ms to provide enough time for the internal RTC LDO output to reach a valid level before RTC reset is released.
- B. The 3.3-V I/O power supplies may be ramped simultaneously with the 1.8-V I/O power supplies if the voltage sourced by any 3.3-V power supplies does not exceed the voltage sourced by any 1.8-V power supply by more than 2 V. Serious reliability issues may occur if the system power supply design allows any 3.3-V I/O power supplies to exceed any 1.8-V I/O power supplies by more than 2 V.
- C.

## 6.1.2 Power-Down Sequencing

PWRONRSTn input terminal should be taken low, which stops all internal clocks before power supplies are turned off. All other external clocks to the device should be shut off.

The preferred way to sequence power down is to have all the power supplies ramped down sequentially in the exact reverse order of the power-up sequencing. In other words, the power supply that has been ramped up first should be the last one that should be ramped down. This ensures there would be no spurious current paths during the power-down sequence. The VDDS power supply must ramp down after all 3.3-V VDDSHVx [1-6] power supplies.

If it is desired to ramp down VDDS and VDDSHVx [1-6] simultaneously, it should always be ensured that the difference between VDDS and VDDSHVx [1-6] during the entire power-down sequence is &lt;2 V. Any violation of this could cause reliability risks for the device. TI recommends maintaining VDDS ≥ 1.5V as all the other supplies fully ramp down to minimize in-rush currents.

If none of the VDDSHVx [1-6] power supplies are configured as 3.3 V, the VDDS power supply may ramp down along with the VDDSHVx [1-6] supplies or after all the VDDSHVx [1-6] supplies have ramped down. TI recommends maintaining VDDS ≥ 1.5V as all the other supplies fully ramp down to minimize in-rush currents.

## 6.2 Clock Specifications

## 6.2.1 Input Clock Specifications

The AM335x device has two clock inputs. Each clock input passes through an internal oscillator which can be connected to an external crystal circuit (oscillator mode) or external LVCMOS square-wave digital clock source (bypass mode). The oscillators automatically operate in bypass mode when their input is connected to an external LVCMOS square-wave digital clock source. The oscillator associated with a specific clock input must be enabled when the clock input is being used in either oscillator mode or bypass mode.

The OSC1 oscillator provides a 32.768-kHz reference clock to the real-time clock (RTC) and is connected to the RTC\_XTALIN and RTC\_XTALOUT terminals. This clock source is referred to as the 32K oscillator (CLK\_32K\_RTC) in the AM335x and AMIC110 Sitara Processors Technical Reference Manual . OSC1 is disabled by default after power is applied. This clock input is optional and may not be required if the RTC is configured to receive a clock from the internal 32k RC oscillator (CLK\_RC32K) or peripheral PLL (CLK\_32KHZ) which receives a reference clock from the OSC0 input.

The OSC0 oscillator provides a 19.2-MHz, 24-MHz, 25-MHz, or 26-MHz reference clock which is used to clock all non-RTC functions and is connected to the XTALIN and XTALOUT terminals. This clock source is referred to as the master oscillator (CLK\_M\_OSC) in the AM335x and AMIC110 Sitara Processors Technical Reference Manual . OSC0 is enabled by default after power is applied.

For more information related to recommended circuit topologies and crystal oscillator circuit requirements for these clock inputs, see Section 6.2.2.

## 6.2.2 Input Clock Requirements

## 6.2.2.1 OSC0 Internal Oscillator Clock Source

Figure 6-9 shows the recommended crystal circuit. TI recommends that preproduction printed-circuit board (PCB) designs include the two optional resistors Rbias and Rd in case they are required for proper oscillator operation when combined with production crystal circuit components. In most cases, Rbias is not required and Rd is a 0Ω resistor. These resistors may be removed from production PCB designs after evaluating oscillator performance with production crystal circuit components installed on preproduction PCBs.

The XTALIN terminal has a 15to 40-k Ω internal pulldown resistor which is enabled when OSC0 is disabled. This internal resistor prevents the XTALIN terminal from floating to an invalid logic level which may increase leakage current through the oscillator input buffer.

- A. Oscillator components (Crystal, C1, C2, optional Rbias and Rd) must be located close to the AM335x package. Parasitic capacitance to the VSS\_OSC and respective crystal circuit component grounds should be connected directly to the nearest PCB digital ground (VSS).
- B. C1 and C2 represent the total capacitance of the respective PCB trace, load capacitor, and other components (excluding the crystal) connected to each crystal terminal. The value of capacitors C1 and C2 should be selected to provide the total load capacitance, C L , specified by the crystal manufacturer. The total load capacitance is C L = [(C 1 × C2) / (C 1 + C2)] + Cshunt , where C shunt is the crystal shunt capacitance (C 0 ) specified by the crystal manufacturer plus any mutual capacitance (Cpkg + CPCB) seen across the AM335x XTALIN and XTALOUT signals.

## 6.2.2.2 OSC0 LVCMOS Digital Clock Source

Figure 6-11 shows the recommended oscillator connections when OSC0 is connected to an LVCMOS square-wave digital clock source. The LVCMOS clock source is connected to the XTALIN terminal. The ground for the LVCMOS clock source and VSS\_OSC should be connected directly to the nearest PCB digital ground (VSS). In this mode of operation, the XTALOUT terminal should not be used to source any external components. The PCB design should provide a mechanism to disconnect the XTALOUT terminal from any external components or signal traces that may couple noise into OSC0 via the XTALOUT terminal.

The XTALIN terminal has a 15to 40-k Ω internal pulldown resistor which is enabled when OSC0 is disabled. This internal resistor prevents the XTALIN terminal from floating to an invalid logic level which may increase leakage current through the oscillator input buffer.

## 6.2.2.3 OSC1 Internal Oscillator Clock Source

Figure 6-12 shows the recommended crystal circuit for OSC1 of the ZCE package and Figure 6-13 shows the recommended crystal circuit for OSC1 of the ZCZ package. TI recommends that preproduction PCB designs include the two optional resistors Rbias and Rd in case they are required for proper oscillator operation when combined with production crystal circuit components. In most cases, Rbias is not required and Rd is a 0Ω resistor. These resistors may be removed from production PCB designs after evaluating oscillator performance with production crystal circuit components installed on preproduction PCBs.

The RTC\_XTALIN terminal has a 10- to 40-k Ω internal pullup resistor which is enabled when OSC1 is disabled. This internal resistor prevents the RTC\_XTALIN terminal from floating to an invalid logic level which may increase leakage current through the oscillator input buffer.

- A. Oscillator components (Crystal, C1, C2, optional Rbias and Rd) must be located close to the AM335x package. Parasitic capacitance to the PCB ground and other signals should be minimized to reduce noise coupled into the oscillator. VSS\_RTC and respective crystal circuit component grounds should be connected directly to the nearest PCB digital ground (VSS).
- B. C1 and C2 represent the total capacitance of the respective PCB trace, load capacitor, and other components (excluding the crystal) connected to each crystal terminal. The value of capacitors C1 and C2 should be selected to provide the total load capacitance, C L , specified by the crystal manufacturer. The total load capacitance is C L = [(C 1 × C2) / (C 1 + C2)] + Cshunt , where C shunt is the crystal shunt capacitance (C 0 ) specified by the crystal manufacturer plus any mutual capacitance (Cpkg + CPCB) seen across the AM335x RTC\_XTALIN and RTC\_XTALOUT signals. For recommended values of crystal circuit components, see Table 6-5.

## 6.2.2.5 OSC1 Not Used

Figure 6-17 shows the recommended oscillator connections when OSC1 of the ZCE package is not used and Figure 6-18 shows the recommended oscillator connections when OSC1 of the ZCZ package is not used. An internal 10-k Ω pullup on the RTC\_XTALIN terminal is turned on when OSC1 is disabled to prevent this input from floating to an invalid logic level which may increase leakage current through the oscillator input buffer. OSC1 is disabled by default after power is applied. Therefore, both RTC\_XTALIN and RTC\_XTALOUT terminals should be a no connect (NC) when OSC1 is not used.

## 6.2.3 Output Clock Specifications

The AM335x device has two clock output signals. The CLKOUT1 signal is always a replica of the OSC0 input clock which is referred to as the master oscillator (CLK\_M\_OSC) in the AM335x and AMIC110 Sitara Processors Technical Reference Manual . The CLKOUT2 signal can be configured to output the OSC1 input clock, which is referred to as the 32K oscillator (CLK\_32K\_RTC) in the AM335x and AMIC110 Sitara Processors Technical Reference Manual , or four other internal clocks. For more information related to configuring these clock output signals, see the CLKOUT Signals section of the AM335x and AMIC110 Sitara Processors Technical Reference Manual .

## 6.2.4 Output Clock Characteristics

## NOTE

The AM335x CLKOUT1 and CLKOUT2 clock outputs should not be used as a synchronous clock for any of the peripheral interfaces because they were not timing closed to any other signals. These clock outputs also were not designed to source any time critical external circuits that require a low jitter reference clock. The jitter performance of these outputs is unpredictable due to complex combinations of many system variables. For example, CLKOUT2 may be sourced from several PLLs with each PLL supporting many configurations that yield different jitter performance. There are also other unpredictable contributors to jitter performance such as application specific noise or crosstalk into the clock circuits. Therefore, there are no plans to specify jitter performance for these outputs.

## 6.2.4.1 CLKOUT1

The CLKOUT1 signal can be output on the XDMA\_EVENT\_INTR0 terminal. This terminal connects to one of seven internal signals via configurable multiplexers. The XDMA\_EVENT\_INTR0 multiplexer must be configured for Mode 3 to connect the CLKOUT1 signal to the XDMA\_EVENT\_INTR0 terminal.

The default reset configuration of the XDMA\_EVENT\_INTR0 multiplexer is selected by the logic level applied to the LCD\_DATA5 terminal on the rising edge of PWRONRSTn. The XDMA\_EVENT\_INTR0 multiplexer is configured to Mode 7 if the LCD\_DATA5 terminal is low on the rising edge of PWRONRSTn or Mode 3 if the LCD\_DATA5 terminal is high on the rising edge of PWRONRSTn. This allows the CLKOUT1 signal to be output on the XDMA\_EVENT\_INTR0 terminal without software intervention. In this mode, the output is held low while PWRONRSTn is active and begins to toggle after PWRONRSTn is released.

## 6.2.4.2 CLKOUT2

The CLKOUT2 signal can be output on the XDMA\_EVENT\_INTR1 terminal. This terminal connects to one of seven internal signals via configurable multiplexers. The XDMA\_EVENT\_INTR1 multiplexer must be configured for Mode 3 to connect the CLKOUT2 signal to the XDMA\_EVENT\_INTR1 terminal.

The default reset configuration of the XDMA\_EVENT\_INTR1 multiplexer is always Mode 7. Software must configure the XDMA\_EVENT\_INTR1 multiplexer to Mode 3 for the CLKOUT2 signal to be output on the XDMA\_EVENT\_INTR1 terminal.

## 7 Peripheral Information and Timings

The AM335x device contains many peripheral interfaces. In order to reduce package size and lower overall system cost while maintaining maximum functionality, many of the AM335x terminals can multiplex up to eight signal functions. Although there are many combinations of pin multiplexing that are possible, only a certain number of sets, called I/O Sets, are valid due to timing limitations. These valid I/O Sets were carefully chosen to provide many possible application scenarios for the user.

Texas Instruments has developed a Windows-based application called Pin Mux Utility that helps a system designer select the appropriate pin-multiplexing configuration for their AM335x-based product design. The Pin Mux Utility provides a way to select valid I/O Sets of specific peripheral interfaces to ensure the pinmultiplexing configuration selected for a design only uses valid I/O Sets supported by the AM335x device.

## 7.1 Parameter Information

The data provided in the following Timing Requirements and Switching Characteristics tables assumes the device is operating within the Recommended Operating Conditions defined in Section 5, unless otherwise noted.

## 7.1.1 Timing Parameters and Board Routing Analysis

The timing parameter values specified in this data manual do not include delays by board routings. As a good board design practice, such delays must always be taken into account. Timing values may be adjusted by increasing or decreasing such delays. TI recommends using the available I/O buffer information specification (IBIS) models to analyze the timing characteristics correctly. If needed, external logic hardware such as buffers may be used to compensate any timing differences.

The timing parameter values specified in this data manual assume the SLEWCTRL bit in each pad control register is configured for fast mode (0b).

For the mDDR(LPDDR), DDR2, DDR3, DDR3L memory interface, it is not necessary to use the IBIS models to analyze timing characteristics. TI provides a PCB routing rules solution that describes the routing rules to ensure the mDDR(LPDDR), DDR2, DDR3, DDR3L memory interface timings are met.

## 7.2 Recommended Clock and Control Signal Transition Behavior

All clocks and control signals must transition between VIH and VIL (or between VIL and VIH) in a monotonic manner.

## 7.6 Ethernet Media Access Controller (EMAC) and Switch

## 7.6.1 EMAC and Switch Electrical Data and Timing

The EMAC and Switch implemented in the AM335x device supports GMII mode, but the AM335x design does not pin out 9 of the 24 GMII signals. This was done to reduce the total number of package terminals. Therefore, the AM335x device does not support GMII mode. MII mode is supported with the remaining GMII signals.

The AM335x and AMIC110 Sitara Processors Technical Reference Manual and this document may reference internal signal names when discussing peripheral input and output signals because many of the AM335x package terminals can be multiplexed to one of several peripheral signals. For example, the AM335x terminal names for port 1 of the EMAC and switch have been changed from GMII to MII to indicate their Mode 0 function, but the internal signal is named GMII. However, documents that describe the Ethernet switch reference these signals by their internal signal name. For a cross-reference of internal signal names to terminal names, see Table 4-2.

Operation of the EMAC and switch is not supported for OPP50.

- A. RGMII[x]\_RCLK must be externally delayed relative to the RGMII[x]\_RD[3:0] and RGMII[x]\_RCTL signals to meet the respective timing requirements.
- B. Data and control information is received using both edges of the clocks. RGMII[x]\_RD[3:0] carries data bits 3-0 on the rising edge of RGMII[x]\_RCLK and data bits 7-4 on the falling edge of RGMII[x]\_RCLK. Similarly, RGMII[x]\_RCTL carries RXDV on rising edge of RGMII[x]\_RCLK and RXERR on falling edge of RGMII[x]\_RCLK.

- A. The EMAC and switch implemented in the AM335x device supports internal delay mode, but timing closure was not performed for this mode of operation. Therefore, the AM335x device does not support internal delay mode.
- B. Data and control information is transmitted using both edges of the clocks. RGMII[x]\_TD[3:0] carries data bits 3-0 on the rising edge of RGMII[x]\_TCLK and data bits 7-4 on the falling edge of RGMII[x]\_TCLK. Similarly, RGMII[x]\_TCTL carries TXEN on rising edge of RGMII[x]\_TCLK and TXERR of falling edge of RGMII[x]\_TCLK.

## 7.7.2 mDDR(LPDDR), DDR2, DDR3, DDR3L Memory Interface

The device has a dedicated interface to mDDR(LPDDR), DDR2, DDR3, and DDR3L SDRAM. It supports JEDEC standard compliant mDDR(LPDDR), DDR2, DDR3, and DDR3L SDRAM devices with a 16-bit data path to external SDRAM memory.

For more details on the mDDR(LPDDR), DDR2, DDR3, and DDR3L memory interface, see the EMIF section of the AM335x and AMIC110 Sitara Processors Technical Reference Manual .

## 7.7.2.1 mDDR (LPDDR) Routing Guidelines

It is common to find industry references to mobile double data rate (mDDR) when discussing JEDEC defined low-power double-data rate (LPDDR) memory devices. The following guidelines use LPDDR when referencing JEDEC defined low-power double-data rate memory devices.

## 7.7.2.1.1 Board Designs

TI only supports board designs that follow the guidelines outlined in this document. The switching characteristics and the timing diagram for the LPDDR memory interface are shown in Table 7-33 and Figure 7-32.

Table 7-33. Switching Characteristics for LPDDR Memory Interface

|   NO. | PARAMETER                | PARAMETER                      |   MIN | MAX   | UNIT   |

|     1 | t c(DDR_CK) t c(DDR_CKn) | Cycle time, DDR_CK and DDR_CKn |     5 | (1)   | ns     |

- (1) The JEDEC JESD209B specification only defines the maximum clock period for LPDDR333 and faster speed bin LPDDR memory devices. To determine the maximum clock period, see the respective LPDDR memory data sheet.

## 7.7.2.1.2 LPDDR Interface

This section provides the timing specification for the LPDDR interface as a PCB design and manufacturing specification. The design rules constrain PCB trace length, PCB trace skew, signal integrity, cross-talk, and signal timing. These rules, when followed, result in a reliable LPDDR memory system without the need for a complex timing closure process. For more information regarding the guidelines for using this LPDDR specification, see Understanding TI's PCB Routing Rule-Based DDR Timing Specification . This application report provides generic guidelines and approach. All the specifications provided in the data manual take precedence over the generic guidelines and must be adhered to for a reliable LPDDR interface operation.

## 7.7.2.1.2.1 LPDDR Interface Schematic

Figure 7-33 shows the schematic connections for 16-bit interface on the AM335x device using one x16 LPDDR device. The AM335x LPDDR memory interface only supports 16-bit-wide mode of operation. The AM335x device can only source one load connected to the DQS[x] and DQ[x] net class signals and one load connected to the CK and ADDR\_CTRL net class signals. For more information related to net classes, see Section 7.7.2.1.2.8.

(1) If the LPDDR interface is operated with a clock frequency less than 200 MHz, lower-speed grade LPDDR devices may be used if the minimum clock period specified for the LPDDR device is less than or equal to the minimum clock period selected for the AM335x LPDDR interface.

## 7.7.2.1.2.3 PCB Stackup

The minimum stackup required for routing the AM335x device is a 4-layer stackup as shown in Table 735. Additional layers may be added to the PCB stackup to accommodate other circuitry, enhance signal integrity and electromagnetic interference performance, or to reduce the size of the PCB footprint.

Table 7-35. Minimum PCB Stackup(1)

|   LAYER | TYPE   | DESCRIPTION           |
|---------|--------|-----------------------|
|       1 | Signal | Top signal routing    |
|       2 | Plane  | Ground                |
|       3 | Plane  | Split Power Plane     |
|       4 | Signal | Bottom signal routing |

(1) All signals that have critical signal integrity requirements should be routed first on layer 1. It may not be possible to route all of these signals on layer 1, therefore requiring routing of some signals on layer 4. When this is done, the signal routes on layer 4 must not cross splits in the power plane.

(1) For the LPDDR device BGA pad size, see the LPDDR device manufacturer documentation.

(2) A 20-10 via may be used if enough power routing resources are available. An 18-10 via allows for more flexible power routing to the AM335x device.

(3) Zo is the nominal singled-ended impedance selected for the PCB.

(4) This parameter specifies the AC characteristic impedance tolerance for each segment of a PCB signal trace relative to the chosen Zo defined by the single-ended impedance parameter.

(5) Tighter impedance control is required to ensure flight time skew is minimal.

## 7.7.2.1.2.4 Placement

Figure 7-34 shows the required placement for the LPDDR devices. The dimensions for this figure are defined in Table 7-37. The placement does not restrict the side of the PCB on which the devices are mounted. The ultimate purpose of the placement is to limit the maximum trace lengths and allow for proper routing space. For single-memory LPDDR systems, the second LPDDR device is omitted from the placement.

## 7.7.2.1.2.5 LPDDR Keepout Region

The region of the PCB used for the LPDDR circuitry must be isolated from other signals. The LPDDR keepout region is defined for this purpose and is shown in Figure 7-35. This region should encompass all LPDDR circuitry and the region size varies with component placement and LPDDR routing. Additional clearances required for the keepout region are shown in Table 7-37. Non-LPDDR signals must not be routed on the same signal layer as LPDDR signals within the LPDDR keepout region. Non-LPDDR signals may be routed in the region provided they are routed on layers separated from LPDDR signal layers by a ground layer. No breaks should be allowed in the reference ground or VDDS\_DDR power plane in this region. In addition, the VDDS\_DDR power plane should cover the entire keepout region.

## 7.7.2.1.2.6 Bulk Bypass Capacitors

Bulk bypass capacitors are required for moderate speed bypassing of the LPDDR and other circuitry. Table 7-38 contains the minimum numbers and capacitance required for the bulk bypass capacitors. Note that this table only covers the bypass needs of the AM335x LPDDR interface and LPDDR devices. Additional bulk bypass capacitance may be needed for other circuitry.

## Table 7-38. Bulk Bypass Capacitors (1)

|   NO. | PARAMETER                                     |   MIN | MAX   | UNIT    |

|     6 | LPDDR#2 bulk bypass total capacitance (2)     |    10 |       | μ F     |

(1) These devices should be placed near the device they are bypassing, but preference should be given to the placement of the high-speed (HS) bypass capacitors.

(2) Only used when two LPDDR devices are used.

## 7.7.2.1.2.7 High-Speed Bypass Capacitors

High-speed (HS) bypass capacitors are critical for proper LPDDR interface operation. It is particularly important to minimize the parasitic series inductance of the HS bypass capacitors, the AM335x device LPDDR power, and the AM335x device LPDDR ground connections. Table 7-39 contains the specification for the HS bypass capacitors as well as for the power connections on the PCB.

(1) LxW, 10-mil units; for example, a 0402 is a 40x20-mil surface-mount capacitor.

(2) An additional HS bypass capacitor can share the connection vias only if it is mounted on the opposite side of the board.

(3) These devices should be placed as close as possible to the device being bypassed.

(4) Per LPDDR device.

## 7.7.2.1.2.9 LPDDR Signal Termination

There is no specific need for adding terminations on the LPDDR interface. However, system designers may evaluate the need for serial terminators for EMI and overshoot reduction. Placement of serial terminations for DQS[x] and DQ[x] net class signals should be determined based on PCB analysis. Placement of serial terminations for ADDR\_CTRL net class signals should be close to the AM335x device. Table 7-42 shows the specifications for the serial terminators in such cases.

## Table 7-42. LPDDR Signal Terminations

|   NO. | PARAMETER                            |   MIN |   TYP | MAX    | UNIT   |

|     1 | CK net class (1)                     |     0 |    22 | Zo (2) | Ω      |
|     2 | ADDR_CTRL net class (1)(3)(4)        |     0 |    22 | Zo (2) | Ω      |
|     3 | DQS0, DQS1, DQ0, and DQ1 net classes |     0 |    22 | Zo (2) | Ω      |

(1) Only series termination is permitted.

(2) Zo is the LPDDR PCB trace characteristic impedance.

(3) Series termination values larger than typical only recommended to address EMI issues.

(4) Series termination values should be uniform across net class.

## 7.7.2.1.3 LPDDR CK and ADDR\_CTRL Routing

Figure 7-36 shows the topology of the routing for the CK and ADDR\_CTRL net classes. The length of signal path AB and AC should be minimized with emphasis to minimize lengths C and D such that length A is the majority of the total length of signal path AB and AC.

## 7.7.2.2 DDR2 Routing Guidelines

## 7.7.2.2.1 Board Designs

TI only supports board designs that follow the guidelines outlined in this document. Table 7-45 and Figure 7-38 show the switching characteristics and timing diagram for the DDR2 memory interface.

Table 7-45. Switching Characteristics for DDR2 Memory Interface

|   NO. | PARAMETER                | PARAMETER                      |   MIN | MAX   | UNIT   |

|     1 | t c(DDR_CK) t c(DDR_CKn) | Cycle time, DDR_CK and DDR_CKn |  3.75 | 8 (1) | ns     |

- (1) The JEDEC JESD79-2F specification defines the maximum clock period of 8 ns for all standard-speed bin DDR2 memory devices. Therefore, all standard-speed bin DDR2 memory devices are required to operate at 125 MHz.

## 7.7.2.2.2 DDR2 Interface

This section provides the timing specification for the DDR2 interface as a PCB design and manufacturing specification. The design rules constrain PCB trace length, PCB trace skew, signal integrity, cross-talk, and signal timing. These rules, when followed, result in a reliable DDR2 memory system without the need for a complex timing closure process. For more information regarding the guidelines for using this DDR2 specification, see Understanding TI's PCB Routing Rule-Based DDR Timing Specification . This application report provides generic guidelines and approach. All the specifications provided in the data manual take precedence over the generic guidelines and must be adhered to for a reliable DDR2 interface operation.

## 7.7.2.2.2.1 DDR2 Interface Schematic

Figure 7-39 shows the schematic connections for 16-bit interface on the AM335x device using one x16 DDR2 device and Figure 7-40 shows the schematic connections for 16-bit interface on the AM335x device using two x8 DDR2 devices. The AM335x DDR2 memory interface only supports 16-bit-wide mode of operation. The AM335x device can only source one load connected to the DQS[x] and DQ[x] net class signals and two loads connected to the CK and ADDR\_CTRL net class signals. For more information related to net classes, see Section 7.7.2.2.2.8.

## 7.7.2.2.2.2 Compatible JEDEC DDR2 Devices

Table 7-46 shows the parameters of the JEDEC DDR2 devices that are compatible with this interface. Generally, the DDR2 interface is compatible with x16 or x8 DDR2-533 speed grade DDR2 devices.

Table 7-46. Compatible JEDEC DDR2 Devices (Per Interface) (1)

|   NO. | PARAMETER                            | MIN      | MAX   | UNIT      |
|-------|--------------------------------------|----------|-------|-----------|
|     1 | JEDEC DDR2 device speed grade (2)    | DDR2-533 |       |           |
|     2 | JEDEC DDR2 device bit width          | x8       | x16   | bits      |
|     3 | JEDEC DDR2 device count              | 1        | 2     | devices   |
|     4 | JEDEC DDR2 device terminal count (3) | 60       | 84    | terminals |

(1) If the DDR2 interface is operated with a clock frequency less than 266 MHz, lower-speed grade DDR2 devices may be used if the minimum clock period specified for the DDR2 device is less than or equal to the minimum clock period selected for the AM335x DDR2 interface.

(2) Higher DDR2 speed grades are supported due to inherent JEDEC DDR2 backward compatibility.

(3) 92-terminal devices are also supported for legacy reasons. New designs will migrate to 84-terminal DDR2 devices. Electrically, the 92and 84-terminal DDR2 devices are the same.

## 7.7.2.2.2.3 PCB Stackup

The minimum stackup required for routing the AM335x device is a 4-layer stackup as shown in Table 747. Additional layers may be added to the PCB stackup to accommodate other circuitry, enhance signal integrity and electromagnetic interference performance, or to reduce the size of the PCB footprint.

Table 7-47. Minimum PCB Stackup(1)

|   LAYER | TYPE   | DESCRIPTION           |
|---------|--------|-----------------------|
|       1 | Signal | Top signal routing    |
|       2 | Plane  | Ground                |
|       3 | Plane  | Split power plane     |
|       4 | Signal | Bottom signal routing |

(1) All signals that have critical signal integrity requirements should be routed first on layer 1. It may not be possible to route all of these signals on layer 1, therefore requiring routing of some signals on layer 4. When this is done, the signal routes on layer 4 must not cross splits in the power plane.

Complete stackup specifications are provided in Table 7-48.

(1) For the DDR2 device BGA pad size, see the DDR2 device manufacturer documentation.

(2) A 20-10 via may be used if enough power routing resources are available. An 18-10 via allows for more flexible power routing to the AM335x device.

(3) Zo is the nominal singled-ended impedance selected for the PCB.

(4) This parameter specifies the AC characteristic impedance tolerance for each segment of a PCB signal trace relative to the chosen Zo defined by the single-ended impedance parameter.

(5) Tighter impedance control is required to ensure flight time skew is minimal.

## 7.7.2.2.2.4 Placement

Figure 7-41 shows the required placement for the DDR2 devices. The dimensions for this figure are defined in Table 7-49. The placement does not restrict the side of the PCB on which the devices are mounted. The ultimate purpose of the placement is to limit the maximum trace lengths and allow for proper routing space. For single-memory DDR2 systems, the second DDR2 device is omitted from the placement.

|     4 | Clearance from non-DDR2 signal to DDR2 keepout region (5)(6) | 4     |       | w      |

- (1) DDR2 keepout region to encompass entire DDR2 routing area.
- (2) For dimension definitions, see Figure 7-41.
- (3) Measurements from center of the AM335x device to center of the DDR2 device.
- (4) For single-memory systems, it is recommended that Y offset be as small as possible.
- (5) w is defined as the signal trace width.
- (6) Non-DDR2 signals allowed within DDR2 keepout region provided they are separated from DDR2 routing layers by a ground plane.

## 7.7.2.2.2.5 DDR2 Keepout Region

The region of the PCB used for the DDR2 circuitry must be isolated from other signals. The DDR2 keepout region is defined for this purpose and is shown in Figure 7-42. This region should encompass all DDR2 circuitry and the region size varies with component placement and DDR2 routing. Additional clearances required for the keepout region are shown in Table 7-49. Non-DDR2 signals must not be routed on the same signal layer as DDR2 signals within the DDR2 keepout region. Non-DDR2 signals may be routed in the region provided they are routed on layers separated from DDR2 signal layers by a ground layer. No breaks should be allowed in the reference ground or VDDS\_DDR power plane in this region. In addition, the VDDS\_DDR power plane should cover the entire keepout region.

## 7.7.2.2.2.6 Bulk Bypass Capacitors

Bulk bypass capacitors are required for moderate speed bypassing of the DDR2 and other circuitry. Table 7-50 contains the minimum numbers and capacitance required for the bulk bypass capacitors. Note that this table only covers the bypass needs of the AM335x DDR2 interface and DDR2 devices. Additional bulk bypass capacitance may be needed for other circuitry.

## Table 7-50. Bulk Bypass Capacitors (1)

|   NO. | PARAMETER                                       |   MIN | UNIT    |

|     6 | DDR2 number 2 bulk bypass total capacitance (2) |    10 | μ F     |

(1) These devices should be placed near the device they are bypassing, but preference should be given to the placement of the high-speed (HS) bypass capacitors.

(2) Only used when two DDR2 devices are used.

## 7.7.2.2.2.7 High-Speed (HS) Bypass Capacitors

HS bypass capacitors are critical for proper DDR2 interface operation. It is particularly important to minimize the parasitic series inductance of the HS bypass capacitors, the AM335x device DDR2 power, and the AM335x device DDR2 ground connections. Table 7-51 contains the specification for the HS bypass capacitors as well as for the power connections on the PCB.

(2) An additional HS bypass capacitor can share the connection vias only if it is mounted on the opposite side of the board.

(3) These devices should be placed as close as possible to the device being bypassed.

## 7.7.2.2.2.8 Net Classes

Table 7-52 lists the clock net classes for the DDR2 interface. Table 7-53 lists the signal net classes, and associated clock net classes, for the signals in the DDR2 interface. These net classes are used for the termination and routing rules that follow.

Table 7-52. Clock Net Class Definitions

| CLOCK NET CLASS   | AM335x PIN NAMES       |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| CK                | DDR_CK and DDR_CKn     |
| DQS0              | DDR_DQS0 and DDR_DQSn0 |
| DQS1              | DDR_DQS1 and DDR_DQSn1 |

| SIGNAL NET CLASS   | ASSOCIATED CLOCK NET CLASS   | AM335x PIN NAMES                                                                  |
|--------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ADDR_CTRL          | CK                           | DDR_BA[2:0], DDR_A[15:0], DDR_CSn0, DDR_CASn, DDR_RASn, DDR_WEn, DDR_CKE, DDR_ODT |

## 7.7.2.2.2.9 DDR2 Signal Termination

Signal terminations are required on the CK and ADDR\_CTRL net class signals. Serial terminations should be used on the CK and ADDR\_CTRL lines and is the preferred termination scheme. On-device terminations (ODTs) are required on the DQS[x] and DQ[x] net class signals. They should be enabled to ensure signal integrity. Table 7-54 shows the specifications for the series terminators. Placement of serial terminations for ADDR\_CTRL net class signals should be close to the AM335x device.

Table 7-54. DDR2 Signal Terminations

|   NO. | PARAMETER                                | MIN   | TYP   | MAX    | UNIT   |
|-------|------------------------------------------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
|     1 | CK net class (1)                         | 0     |       | 10     | Ω      |
|     2 | ADDR_CTRL net class (1)(2)(3)            | 0     | 22    | Zo (4) | Ω      |
|     3 | DQS0, DQS1, DQ0, and DQ1 net classes (5) | N/A   |       | N/A    | Ω      |

(1) Only series termination is permitted.

(2) Series termination values larger than typical only recommended to address EMI issues.

- (3) Series termination values should be uniform across net class.
- (4) Zo is the DDR2 PCB trace characteristic impedance.
- (5) No external termination resistors are allowed and ODT must be used for these net classes.

If the DDR2 interface is operated at a lower frequency (&lt;200-MHz clock rate), on-device terminations are not specifically required for the DQS[x] and DQ[x] net class signals and serial terminations for the CK and ADDR\_CTRL net class signals are not mandatory. System designers may evaluate the need for serial terminators for EMI and overshoot reduction. Placement of serial terminations for DQS[x] and DQ[x] net class signals should be determined based on PCB analysis. Placement of serial terminations for ADDR\_CTRL net class signals should be close to the AM335x device. Table 7-55 shows the specifications for the serial terminators in such cases.

Table 7-55. Lower-Frequency DDR2 Signal Terminations

|   NO. | PARAMETER                            |   MIN |   TYP | MAX    | UNIT   |

|     1 | CK net class (1)                     |     0 |    22 | Zo (2) | Ω      |
|     2 | ADDR_CTRL net class (1)(3)(4)        |     0 |    22 | Zo (2) | Ω      |
|     3 | DQS0, DQS1, DQ0, and DQ1 net classes |     0 |    22 | Zo (2) | Ω      |

(1) Only series termination is permitted.

(2) Zo is the DDR2 PCB trace characteristic impedance.

(3) Series termination values larger than typical only recommended to address EMI issues.

(4) Series termination values should be uniform across net class.

## 7.7.2.2.2.10 DDR\_VREF Routing

DDR\_VREF is used as a reference by the input buffers of the DDR2 memories as well as the AM335x device. DDR\_VREF is intended to be half the DDR2 power supply voltage and should be created using a resistive divider as shown in Figure 7-39 and Figure 7-40. TI does not recommend other methods of creating DDR\_VREF. Figure 7-43 shows the layout guidelines for DDR\_VREF.

## 7.7.2.2.3 DDR2 CK and ADDR\_CTRL Routing

Figure 7-44 shows the topology of the routing for the CK and ADDR\_CTRL net classes. The length of signal path AB and AC should be minimized with emphasis to minimize lengths C and D such that length A is the majority of the total length of signal path AB and AC.

(1) CK represents the clock net class, and ADDR\_CTRL represents the address and control signal net class.

- (2) Series terminator, if used, should be located closest to the AM335x device.
- (3) Differential impedance should be Zo x 2, where Zo is the single-ended impedance defined in Table 7-48.
- (4) Center-to-center spacing is allowed to fall to minimum (w) for up to 500 mils of routed length to accommodate BGA escape and routing congestion.
- (5) CACLM is the longest Manhattan distance of the CK and ADDR\_CTRL net classes.

Figure 7-45 shows the topology and routing for the DQS[x] and DQ[x] net classes; the routes are point to point. Skew matching across bytes is not needed nor recommended.

(1) DQS[x] represents the DQS0 and DQS1 clock net classes, and DQ[x] represents the DQ0 and DQ1 signal net classes.

(2) Differential impedance should be Zo x 2, where Zo is the single-ended impedance defined in Table 7-48.

(3) Center-to-center spacing is allowed to fall to minimum (w) for up to 500 mils of routed length to accommodate BGA escape and routing congestion.

- (4) There is no requirement for skew matching between data bytes; that is, from net classes DQS0 and DQ0 to net classes DQS1 and DQ1.
- (5) Signals from one DQ net class should be considered other DDR2 traces to another DQ net class.
- (6) DQLM is the longest Manhattan distance of each of the DQS[x] and DQ[x] net classes.

## 7.7.2.3 DDR3 and DDR3L Routing Guidelines

## NOTE

All references to DDR3 in this section apply to DDR3 and DDR3L devices, unless otherwise noted.

## 7.7.2.3.1 Board Designs

TI only supports board designs using DDR3 memory that follow the guidelines in this document. The switching characteristics and timing diagram for the DDR3 memory interface are shown in Table 7-58 and Figure 7-46.

Table 7-58. Switching Characteristics for DDR3 Memory Interface

|   NO. | PARAMETER                | PARAMETER                      |   MIN | MAX     | UNIT   |
|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|---------|--------|
|     1 | t c(DDR_CK) t c(DDR_CKn) | Cycle time, DDR_CK and DDR_CKn |   2.5 | 3.3 (1) | ns     |

- (1) The JEDEC JESD79-3F Standard defines the maximum clock period of 3.3 ns for all standard-speed bin DDR3 and DDR3L memory devices. Therefore, all standard-speed bin DDR3 and DDR3L memory devices are required to operate at 303 MHz.

## 7.7.2.3.1.1 DDR3 versus DDR2

This specification only covers AM335x PCB designs that use DDR3 memory. Designs using DDR2 memory should use the DDR2 routing guidleines described in Section 7.7.2.2. While similar, the two memory systems have different requirements. It is currently not possible to design one PCB that meets the requirements of both DDR2 and DDR3.

## 7.7.2.3.2 DDR3 Device Combinations

Because there are several possible combinations of device counts and single-side or dual-side mounting, Table 7-59 summarizes the supported device configurations.

Table 7-59. Supported DDR3 Device Combinations

|   NUMBER OF DDR3 DEVICES |   DDR3 DEVICE WIDTH (BITS) | MIRRORED?   |   DDR3 EMIF WIDTH (BITS) |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
|                        1 |                         16 | N           |                       16 |
|                        2 |                          8 | Y (1)       |                       16 |

(1) Two DDR3 devices are mirrored when one device is placed on the top of the board and the second device is placed on the bottom of the board.

## 7.7.2.3.3 DDR3 Interface

This section provides the timing specification for the DDR3 interface as a PCB design and manufacturing specification. The design rules constrain PCB trace length, PCB trace skew, signal integrity, cross-talk, and signal timing. These rules, when followed, result in a reliable DDR3 memory system without the need for a complex timing closure process. For more information regarding the guidelines for using this DDR3 specification, see Understanding TI's PCB Routing Rule-Based DDR Timing Specification . This application report provides generic guidelines and approach. All the specifications provided in the data manual take precedence over the generic guidelines and must be adhered to for a reliable DDR3 interface operation.

## 7.7.2.3.3.1 DDR3 Interface Schematic

The DDR3 interface schematic varies, depending upon the width of the DDR3 devices used. Figure 7-47 shows the schematic connections for 16-bit interface on the AM335x device using one x16 DDR3 device and Figure 7-49 shows the schematic connections for 16-bit interface on the AM335x device using two x8 DDR3 devices. The AM335x DDR3 memory interface only supports 16-bit wide mode of operation. The AM335x device can only source one load connected to the DQS[x] and DQ[x] net class signals and two loads connected to the CK and ADDR\_CTRL net class signals. For more information related to net classes, see Section 7.7.2.3.3.8.

## 7.7.2.3.3.2 Compatible JEDEC DDR3 Devices

Table 7-60 shows the parameters of the JEDEC DDR3 devices that are compatible with this interface.

(1) For valid DDR3 device configurations and device counts, see Section 7.7.2.3.3.1, Figure 7-47, and Figure 7-49.

## 7.7.2.3.3.3 PCB Stackup

The minimum stackup for routing the DDR3 interface is a four-layer stack up as shown in Table 7-61. Additional layers may be added to the PCB stackup to accommodate other circuitry, enhance signal integrity and electromagnetic interference performance, or to reduce the size of the PCB footprint.

Table 7-61. Minimum PCB Stackup (1)

|   LAYER | TYPE   | DESCRIPTION           |
|---------|--------|-----------------------|
|       1 | Signal | Top signal routing    |
|       2 | Plane  | Ground                |
|       3 | Plane  | Split Power Plane     |
|       4 | Signal | Bottom signal routing |

(1) All signals that have critical signal integrity requirements should be routed first on layer 1. It may not be possible to route all of these signals on layer 1, therefore requiring routing of some signals on layer 4. When this is done, the signal routes on layer 4 must not cross splits in the power plane.

(1) For the DDR3 device BGA pad size, see the DDR3 device manufacturer documentation.

(2) Ground reference layers are preferred over power reference layers. Be sure to include bypass capacitors to accommodate reference layer return current as the trace routes switch routing layers.

- (3) No traces should cross reference plane cuts within the DDR3 routing region. High-speed signal traces crossing reference plane cuts create large return current paths which can lead to excessive crosstalk and EMI radiation.
- (4) Reference planes are to be directly adjacent to the signal plane to minimize the size of the return current loop.
- (5) An 18-mil pad assumes Via Channel is the most economical BGA escape. A 20-mil pad may be used if additional layers are available for power routing. An 18-mil pad is required for minimum layer count escape.
- (6) Zo is the nominal singled-ended impedance selected for the PCB.
- (7) This parameter specifies the AC characteristic impedance tolerance for each segment of a PCB signal trace relative to the chosen Zo defined by the single-ended impedance parameter.
- (8) Tighter impedance control is required to ensure flight time skew is minimal.

## 7.7.2.3.3.4 Placement

Figure 7-50 shows the required placement for the AM335x device as well as the DDR3 devices. The dimensions for this figure are defined in Table 7-63. The placement does not restrict the side of the PCB on which the devices are mounted. The ultimate purpose of the placement is to limit the maximum trace lengths and allow for proper routing space.

|     4 | Clearance from non-DDR3 signal to DDR3 keepout region (5)(6) | 4     |       | w      |

- (3) Measurements from center of the AM335x device to center of the DDR3 device.
- (4) Minimizing X1 and Y improves timing margins.
- (5) w is defined as the signal trace width.
- (6) Non-DDR3 signals allowed within DDR3 keepout region provided they are separated from DDR3 routing layers by a ground plane.

<!-- image -->

## 7.7.2.3.3.5 DDR3 Keepout Region

The region of the PCB used for DDR3 circuitry must be isolated from other signals. The DDR3 keepout region is defined for this purpose and is shown in Figure 7-51. This region should encompass all DDR3 circuitry and the region size varies with component placement and DDR3 routing. Additional clearances required for the keepout region are shown in Table 7-63. Non-DDR3 signals must not be routed on the same signal layer as DDR3 signals within the DDR3 keepout region. Non-DDR3 signals may be routed in the region provided they are routed on layers separated from DDR3 signal layers by a ground layer. No breaks should be allowed in the reference ground or VDDS\_DDR power plane in this region. In addition, the VDDS\_DDR power plane should cover the entire keepout region.

## 7.7.2.3.3.6 Bulk Bypass Capacitors

Bulk bypass capacitors are required for moderate speed bypassing of the DDR3 and other circuitry. Table 7-64 contains the minimum numbers and capacitance required for the bulk bypass capacitors. Note that this table only covers the bypass needs of the AM335x DDR3 interface and DDR3 devices. Additional bulk bypass capacitance may be needed for other circuitry.

## Table 7-64. Bulk Bypass Capacitors (1)

|   NO. | PARAMETER                                       |   MIN | UNIT    |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|
|     1 | AM335x VDDS_DDR bulk bypass capacitor count     |     2 | devices |
|     2 | AM335x VDDS_DDR bulk bypass total capacitance   |    20 | μ F     |
|     3 | DDR3 number 1 bulk bypass capacitor count       |     2 | devices |
|     4 | DDR3 number 1 bulk bypass total capacitance     |    20 | μ F     |
|     5 | DDR3 number 2 bulk bypass capacitor count (2)   |     2 | devices |
|     6 | DDR3 number 2 bulk bypass total capacitance (2) |    20 | μ F     |

(1) These devices should be placed near the devices they are bypassing, but preference should be given to the placement of the highspeed (HS) bypass capacitors and DDR3 signal routing.

(2) Only used when two DDR3 devices are used.

## 7.7.2.3.3.7 High-Speed Bypass Capacitors

High-speed (HS) bypass capacitors are critical for proper DDR3 interface operation. It is particularly important to minimize the parasitic series inductance of the HS bypass capacitors, the AM335x device DDR3 power, and the AM335x device DDR3 ground connections. Table 7-65 contains the specification for the HS bypass capacitors as well as for the power connections on the PCB. Generally speaking, it is good to:

- Fit as many HS bypass capacitors as possible.
- Minimize the distance from the bypass capacitor to the power terminals being bypassed.
- Use the smallest physical sized capacitors possible with the highest capacitance readily available.
- Connect the bypass capacitor pads to their vias using the widest traces possible and using the largest hole size via possible.
- Minimize via sharing. Note the limits on via sharing shown in Table 7-65.

## Table 7-65. High-Speed Bypass Capacitors

|   NO. | PARAMETER                                                                                  | MIN   | TYP   | MAX   | UNIT    |

(1) LxW, 10-mil units; for example, a 0402 is a 40x20-mil surface-mount capacitor.

(2) Closer and shorter is better.

(3) Measured from the nearest AM335x VDDS\_DDR and ground terminal to the center of the capacitor package.

(4) Three of these capacitors should be located underneath the AM335x device, between the cluster of VDDS\_DDR and ground terminals, between the DDR3 interfaces on the package.

(5) Measured from the DDR3 device power and ground terminal to the center of the capacitor package.

(6) Per DDR3 device.

- (7) An additional HS bypass capacitor can share the connection vias only if it is mounted on the opposite side of the board. No sharing of vias is permitted on the same side of the board.

(8) An HS bypass capacitor may share a via with a DDR3 device mounted on the same side of the PCB. A wide trace should be used for the connection and the length from the capacitor pad to the DDR3 device pad should be less than 150 mils.

- (9) Up to two pairs of DDR3 power and ground terminals may share a via.

## 7.7.2.3.3.7.1 Return Current Bypass Capacitors

Use additional bypass capacitors if the return current reference plane changes due to DDR3 signals hopping from one signal layer to another. The bypass capacitor here provides a path for the return current to hop planes along with the signal. As many of these return current bypass capacitors should be used as possible. Because these are returns for signal current, the signal via size may be used for these capacitors.

## 7.7.2.3.3.8 Net Classes

Table 7-66 lists the clock net classes for the DDR3 interface. Table 7-67 lists the signal net classes, and associated clock net classes, for signals in the DDR3 interface. These net classes are used for the termination and routing rules that follow.

Table 7-66. Clock Net Class Definitions

| CLOCK NET CLASS   | AM335x PIN NAMES       |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| CK                | DDR_CK and DDR_CKn     |
| DQS0              | DDR_DQS0 and DDR_DQSn0 |

## 7.7.2.3.3.9 DDR3 Signal Termination

Signal terminations are required for the CK and ADDR\_CTRL net class signals. On-device terminations (ODTs) are required on the DQS[x] and DQ[x] net class signals. Detailed termination specifications are covered in the routing rules in the following sections.

Figure 7-48 provides an example DDR3 schematic with a single 16-bit DDR3 memory device that does not have VTT termination on the address and control signals. A typical DDR3 point-to-point topology may provide acceptable signal integrity without VTT termination. System performance should be verified by performing signal integrity analysis using specific PCB design details before implementing this topology.

## 7.7.2.3.3.10 DDR\_VREF Routing

DDR\_VREF is used as a reference by the input buffers of the DDR3 memories as well as the AM335x device. DDR\_VREF is intended to be half the DDR3 power supply voltage and is typically generated with a voltage divider connected to the VDDS\_DDR power supply. It should be routed as a nominal 20-mil wide trace with 0.1 µF bypass capacitors near each device connection. Narrowing of DDR\_VREF is allowed to accommodate routing congestion.

## 7.7.2.3.3.11 VTT

Like DDR\_VREF, the nominal value of the VTT supply is half the DDR3 supply voltage. Unlike DDR\_VREF, VTT is expected to source and sink current, specifically the termination current for the ADDR\_CTRL net class Thevinen terminators. VTT is needed at the end of the address bus and it should be routed as a power sub-plane. VTT should be bypassed near the terminator resistors.

## 7.7.2.3.4 DDR3 CK and ADDR\_CTRL Topologies and Routing Definition

The CK and ADDR\_CTRL net classes are routed similarly and are length matched to minimize skew between them. CK is a bit more complicated because it runs at a higher transition rate and is differential. The following subsections show the topology and routing for various DDR3 configurations for CK and ADDR\_CTRL. The figures in the following subsections define the terms for the routing specification detailed in Table 7-68.

## 7.7.2.3.4.1 Two DDR3 Devices

Two DDR3 devices are supported on the DDR3 interface consisting of two x8 DDR3 devices arranged as one 16-bit bank. These two devices may be mounted on a single side of the PCB, or may be mirrored in a pair to save board space at a cost of increased routing complexity and parts on the backside of the PCB.

## 7.7.2.3.5 Data Topologies and Routing Definition

No matter the number of DDR3 devices used, the data line topology is always point to point, so its definition is simple.

## 7.7.2.3.5.1 DQS[x] and DQ[x] Topologies, Any Number of Allowed DDR3 Devices

## 7.7.2.3.6 Routing Specification

## 7.7.2.3.6.1 CK and ADDR\_CTRL Routing Specification

Skew within the CK and ADDR\_CTRL net classes directly reduces setup and hold margin and, thus, this skew must be controlled. The only way to practically match lengths on a PCB is to lengthen the shorter traces up to the length of the longest net in the net class and its associated clock. A metric to establish this maximum length is Manhattan distance. The Manhattan distance between two points on a PCB is the length between the points when connecting them only with horizontal or vertical segments. A reasonable trace route length is to within a percentage of its Manhattan distance. CACLM is defined as Clock Address Control Longest Manhattan distance.

Given the clock and address pin locations on the AM335x device and the DDR3 memories, the maximum possible Manhattan distance can be determined given the placement. Figure 7-66 shows this distance for two loads. The specifications on the lengths of the transmission lines for the address bus are determined from this distance. CACLM is determined similarly for other address bus configurations; that is, it is based on the longest net of the CK and ADDR\_CTRL net class. For CK and ADDR\_CTRL routing, these specifications are contained in Table 7-68.

<!-- image -->

- A. It is very likely that the longest CK and ADDR\_CTRL Manhattan distance will be for Address Input 8 (A8) on the DDR3 memories. CACLM is based on the longest Manhattan distance due to the device placement. Verify the net class that satisfies this criteria and use as the baseline for CK and ADDR\_CTRL skew matching and length control.

The length of shorter CK and ADDR\_CTRL stubs as well as the length of the terminator stub are not included in this length calculation. Nonincluded lengths are grayed out in the figure.

Assuming A8 is the longest, CALM = CACLMY + CACLMX + 300 mils. The extra 300 mils allows for routing down lower than the DDR3 memories and returning up to reach A8.

- (1) CK represents the clock net class, and ADDR\_CTRL represents the address and control signal net class.
- (2) The use of vias should be minimized.
- (3) Additional bypass capacitors are required when using the VDDS\_DDR plane as the reference plane to allow the return current to jump between the VDDS\_DDR plane and the ground plane when the net class switches layers at a via.
- (4) Mirrored configuration (one DDR3 device on top of the board and one DDR3 device on the bottom).
- (5) Nonmirrored configuration (all DDR3 memories on same side of PCB).
- (6) While this length can be increased for convenience, its length should be minimized.
- (7) ADDR\_CTRL net class only (not CK net class). Minimizing this skew is recommended, but not required.
- (8) CK net class only.
- (9) CACLM is the longest Manhattan distance of the CK and ADDR\_CTRL net classes + 300 mils. For definition, see Section 7.7.2.3.6.1 and Figure 7-66.
- (10) Center-to-center spacing is allowed to fall to minimum (w) for up to 1250 mils of routed length.
- (11) Signals from one DQ net class should be considered other DDR3 traces to another DQ net class.
- (12) CK spacing set to ensure proper differential impedance. Differential impedance should be Zo x 2, where Zo is the single-ended impedance defined in Table 7-62.
- (13) Source termination (series resistor at driver) is specifically not allowed.
- (14) Termination values should be uniform across the net class.

## 7.7.2.3.6.2 DQS[x] and DQ[x] Routing Specification

Skew within the DQS[x] and DQ[x] net classes directly reduces setup and hold margin and, thus, this skew must be controlled. The only way to practically match lengths on a PCB is to lengthen the shorter traces up to the length of the longest net in the net class and its associated clock. DQLMn is defined as DQ Longest Manhattan distance n, where n is the byte number. For a 16-bit interface, there are two DQLMs, DQLM0-DQLM1.

## NOTE

Matching the lengths across all bytes is not required, nor is it recommended. Length matching is only required within each byte.

Given the DQS[x] and DQ[x] pin locations on the AM335x device and the DDR3 memories, the maximum possible Manhattan distance can be determined given the placement. Figure 7-67 shows this distance for a two-load case. It is from this distance that the specifications on the lengths of the transmission lines for the data bus are determined. For DQS[x] and DQ[x] routing, these specifications are contained in Table 769.

<!-- image -->

There are two DQLMs, one for each byte (16-bit interface). Each DQLM is the longest Manhattan distance of the byte; therefore:

DQLM0 = DQLMX0 + DQLMY0

DQLM1 = DQLMX1 + DQLMY1

- (1) DQS[x] represents the DQS0 and DQS1 clock net classes, and DQ[x] represents the DQ0 and DQ1 signal net classes.
- (2) External termination disallowed. Data termination should use built-in ODT functionality.
- (3) DQLMn is the longest Manhattan distance of a byte. For definition, see Section 7.7.2.3.6.2 and Figure 7-67.
- (4) DQLM0 is the longest Manhattan length for the DQ0 net class.
- (5) DQLM1 is the longest Manhattan length for the DQ1 net class.
- (6) Length matching is only done within a byte. Length matching across bytes is not required.
- (7) Each DQS clock net class is length matched to its associated DQ signal net class.
- (8) Center-to-center spacing is allowed to fall to minimum for up to 1250 mils of routed length.
- (9) Other DDR3 trace spacing means signals that are not part of the same DQ[x] signal net class.
- (10) This applies to spacing within same DQ[x] signal net class.
- (11) DQS[x] pair spacing is set to ensure proper differential impedance. Differential impedance should be Z o x 2, where Zo is the singleended impedance defined in Table 7-62.

(1) A fast-mode I 2 C-bus device can be used in a standard-mode I 2 C-bus system, but the requirement tsu(SDA-SCLH) ≥ 250 ns must then be met. This is automatically the case if the device does not stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal. If such a device stretches the LOW period of the SCL signal, it must output the next data bit to the SDA line t r max + t su(SDA-SCLH) = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns (according to the standard-mode I 2 C-Bus Specification) before the SCL line is released.

(2) A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (referred to the V IHmin of the SCL signal) to bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.

(3) The maximum th(SDA-SCLL) has only to be met if the device does not stretch the low period [t w(SCLL) ] of the SCL signal.

## 7.10 LCD Controller (LCDC)

The LCDC consists of two independent controllers, the raster controller and the LCD interface display driver (LIDD) controller. Each controller operates independently from the other and only one of them is active at any given time.

- The raster controller handles the synchronous LCD interface. It provides timing and data for constant graphics refresh to a passive display. It supports a wide variety of monochrome and full-color display types and sizes by use of programmable timing controls, a built-in palette, and a gray-scale and serializer. Graphics data is processed and stored in frame buffers. A frame buffer is a contiguous memory block in the system. A built-in DMA engine supplies the graphics data to the raster engine which, in turn, outputs to the external LCD device.
- The LIDD controller supports the asynchronous LCD interface. It provides full-timing programmability of control signals (CS, WE, OE, ALE) and output data.

The maximum resolution for the LCD controller is 2048 × 2048 pixels. The maximum frame rate is determined by the image size in combination with the pixel clock rate.

Frame-to-frame timing is derived through the following parameters in the LCD (RASTER\_TIMING\_1) register:

- Vertical front porch (VFP)
- Vertical sync pulse width (VSW)
- Vertical back porch (VBP)
- Lines per panel (LPP\_B10 + LPP)

Line-to-line timing is derived through the following parameters in the LCD (RASTER\_TIMING\_0) register:

- Horizontal front porch (HFP)
- Horizontal sync pulse width (HSW)
- Horizontal back porch (HBP)
- Pixels per panel (PPLMSB + PPLLSB)

LCD\_AC\_BIAS\_EN timing is derived through the following parameter in the LCD (RASTER\_TIMING\_2) register:

- AC bias frequency (ACB)

The display format produced in raster mode is shown in Figure 7-81. An entire frame is delivered one line at a time. The first line delivered starts at data pixel (1, 1) and ends at data pixel (P, 1). The last line delivered starts at data pixel (1, L) and ends at data pixel (P, L). The beginning of each new frame is denoted by the activation of I/O signal LCD\_VSYNC. The beginning of each new line is denoted by the activation of I/O signal LCD\_HSYNC.

## 7.11 Multichannel Audio Serial Port (McASP)

The multichannel audio serial port (McASP) functions as a general-purpose audio serial port optimized for the needs of multichannel audio applications. The McASP is useful for time-division multiplexed (TDM) stream, Inter-Integrated Sound (I 2 S) protocols, and inter-component digital audio interface transmission (DIT).

## 7.11.1 McASP Device-Specific Information

The device includes two multichannel audio serial port (McASP) interface peripherals (McASP0 and McASP1). The McASP module consists of a transmit and receive section. These sections can operate completely independently with different data formats, separate master clocks, bit clocks, and frame syncs or, alternatively, the transmit and receive sections may be synchronized. The McASP module also includes shift registers that may be configured to operate as either transmit data or receive data.

The transmit section of the McASP can transmit data in either a time-division-multiplexed (TDM) synchronous serial format or in a digital audio interface (DIT) format where the bit stream is encoded for SPDIF, AES-3, IEC-60958, CP-430 transmission. The receive section of the McASP peripheral supports the TDM synchronous serial format.

The McASP module can support one transmit data format (either a TDM format or DIT format) and one receive format at a time. All transmit shift registers use the same format and all receive shift registers use the same format; however, the transmit and receive formats need not be the same. Both the transmit and receive sections of the McASP also support burst mode, which is useful for nonaudio data (for example, passing control information between two devices).

The McASP peripheral has additional capability for flexible clock generation and error detection/handling, as well as error management.

The device McASP0 and McASP1 modules have up to four serial data pins each. The McASP FIFO size is 256 bytes and two DMA and two interrupt requests are supported. Buffers are used transparently to better manage DMA, which can be leveraged to manage data flow more efficiently.

For more detailed information on and the functionality of the McASP peripheral, see the Multichannel Audio Serial Port (McASP) section of the AM335x and AMIC110 Sitara Processors Technical Reference Manual .

## 8 Device and Documentation Support

## 8.1 Device Nomenclature

To designate the stages in the product development cycle, TI assigns prefixes to the part numbers of all microprocessors (MPUs) and support tools. Each device has one of three prefixes: X, P, or null (no prefix) (for example, XAM3358AZCE). Texas Instruments recommends two of three possible prefix designators for its support tools: TMDX and TMDS. These prefixes represent evolutionary stages of product development from engineering prototypes (TMDX) through fully qualified production devices and tools (TMDS).

Device development evolutionary flow:

- X Experimental device that is not necessarily representative of the final device's specifications and may not use production assembly flow.

electrical

- P Prototype device that is not necessarily the final silicon die and may not necessarily meet final electrical specifications.

null

Production version of the silicon die that is fully qualified.

Support tool development evolutionary flow:

TMDX

Development-support product that has not yet completed Texas Instruments internal qualification testing.

TMDS

Fully-qualified development-support product.

X and P devices and TMDX development-support tools are shipped against the following disclaimer:

"Developmental product is intended for internal evaluation purposes."

Production devices and TMDS development-support tools have been characterized fully, and the quality and reliability of the device have been demonstrated fully. TI's standard warranty applies.

Predictions show that prototype devices (X or P) have a greater failure rate than the standard production devices. Texas Instruments recommends that these devices not be used in any production system because their expected end-use failure rate still is undefined. Only qualified production devices are to be used.

TI device nomenclature also includes a suffix with the device family name. This suffix indicates the package type (for example, ZCE), the temperature range (for example, blank is the default commercial temperature range), and the device speed range, in megahertz (for example, 27 is 275 MHz). Figure 8-1 provides a legend for reading the complete device name for any AM335x device.

For orderable part numbers of AM335x devices in the ZCE and ZCZ package types, see the Package Option Addendum of this document, ti.com, or contact your TI sales representative.

For additional description of the device nomenclature markings on the die, see the AM335x Sitara Processors Silicon Errata .

## 9 Mechanical, Packaging, and Orderable Information

## 9.1 Via Channel

The ZCE package has been specially engineered with Via Channel technology. This allows larger than normal PCB via and trace sizes and reduced PCB signal layers to be used in a PCB design with the 0.65mm pitch package, and substantially reduces PCB costs. It allows PCB routing in only two signal layers (four layers total) due to the increased layer efficiency of the Via Channel BGA technology.

Via Channel technology implemented on the ZCE package makes it possible to build an AM335x-based product with a 4-layer PCB, but a 4-layer PCB may not meet system performance goals. Therefore, system performance using a 4-layer PCB design must be evaluated during product design.

(1) Status: For more details on status, see our product life cycle.

(2) Material type: When designated, preproduction parts are prototypes/experimental devices, and are not yet approved or released for full production. Testing and final process, including without limitation quality assurance, reliability performance testing, and/or process qualification, may not yet be complete, and this item is subject to further changes or possible discontinuation. If available for ordering, purchases will be subject to an additional waiver at checkout, and are intended for early internal evaluation purposes only. These items are sold without warranties of any kind.

(3) RoHS values: Yes, No, RoHS Exempt. See the TI RoHS Statement for additional information and value definition.

(4) Lead finish/Ball material: Parts may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.

(5) MSL rating/Peak reflow: The moisture sensitivity level ratings and peak solder (reflow) temperatures. In the event that a part has multiple moisture sensitivity ratings, only the lowest level per JEDEC standards is shown. Refer to the shipping label for the actual reflow temperature that will be used to mount the part to the printed circuit board.

(6) Part marking: There may be an additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category of the part.

Multiple part markings will be inside parentheses. Only one part marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a part. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire part marking for that device.
