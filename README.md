# TI AM335x SoC Documentation Project

## Overview

This project provides comprehensive, AI-agent and human-readable documentation for the Texas Instruments AM335x System-on-Chip (SoC), commonly used in the BeagleBone Black (AM3358) and other embedded systems. Includes RAG 
summaries of key hardware components by Claude 4. Reference documents where broken down by section and then passed
through docling to get more parseable/debuggable (and hopefully human readable) documents. Documents in docs are
corrected by a mix of Claude 4 RAG and manual review.

## Purpose

- **For AI Agents**: Structured, searchable documentation with clear implementation details
- **For Humans**: Organized reference materials with cross-links and practical examples
- **For Developers**: Implementation guides, register references, and integration patterns
